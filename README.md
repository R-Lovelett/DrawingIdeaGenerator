# What I Learned

This project was created with the intention of teaching myself how to use some of IntelliJ's features
for the first time, along with IntelliJ's Github integration tools and how to use them to work on Github repositories.

- How to setup Git Version Control inside of IntelliJ.
- How to pull, confirm, and push changes of code to Github.
- Refresh memory on Object Oriented Programming.
